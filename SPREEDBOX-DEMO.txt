## Spreedbox demo

## Wifi

Auto joins wifi SSID `blah` with password `struktur` (DHCP).
Make sure the Wifi hotspot is active before booting the
Spreedbox.

The Spreedbox will request the DNS name `spreedbox` from
the DHCP server, so it is easy to access by using that
name for all network requests.

## Automatic LED 

 - Spreedme blue color LED when ready.
 - Red LED color when booting.
 - Red blinking when starting services.

## Spreedbox WebRTC web access

  https://spreedbox/ 

  The TLS certificate is self signed.

## SSH access

  ssh root@spreedbox 
  Password: spreed

## Controlling LED manually

  The LEDs can be controlled manually by pre-defined
  scripts in `/root/blink`. Connect by SSH and then
  for example:

    `/root/blink/incoming.call.sh`

  The color will be applied permanently. Use the `idle.sh`
  script to reset to idle status again.

  Raw access to the dotstar socket, is provided through
  the `dotstar-control` command. For usage see the existing
  blink scripts.
