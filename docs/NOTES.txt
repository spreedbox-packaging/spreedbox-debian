## Dynamic DNS

  In case the box is setup behind NAT with dynamic IP address a dynamic DNS
  host is required so the box can be reached with a well known address.

## Automatically create port forwarding

  To be available from the outside world, the box needs to be reachable from
  the outside. The web interface is on port 443/tcp by default and should be
  forwarded in case of NAT.

  There are several ways for  the box to do this directly on the router.

    - natpmp-utils (alternative to UPNP defined by Apple)
    - miniupnpc
    - upnpc -a `ifconfig wlan0 | grep "inet addr" | cut -d : -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 1` 443 443 TCP

## Spreed WebRTC

  Stock installation compiled for ARM, running with SSL certificate on
  all IPs on port 443.

## SPI

  Load SPI modules spicc and spidev by adding them to /etc/modules.

## Certificates and Keys

  Generating the DH keys takes around 10 minutes. This has to be completed
  at least once. We should consider to run this in the brackground and only
  generate a small DH key size on first boot blocking.

  During setup, the LED's should blink in some pattern to indicate that 
  setup and key generation is in progress. When finished the LED's should
  either turn off or light in some color signaling "ready" or "setup".

## Initial setup

  The IP after first boot and in setup mode needs to be accessed by the
  user to set up the box. The IPv4 address should be broadcasted using
  the LED's until setup is completed.

  In adition the box should broadcast using bounjour/avahi about itself.

## Default configuration

  The box should have a default configuration, which does not require much
  except creating the initial user. Before that is complete, the box should
  not be operational. Setup access should be only possible from the same
  network segment as the box is connected to.

  The box should also auto disable setup after it was not set up n minutes
  after boot. To set up, the box should be rebooted.

## File system

  The posibilities of file system damage or that something goes wrong are
  hight. We should consider running btrfs with automatic snapshots when
  something goes wrong.

## Login to the box

  The box has local users. These users need to be authenticated somehow. I
  guess we cannot avoid to have the possibility to use passwords. Though the
  box should allow authentication by client certificate too. In addition
  we should exploint OpenID connect to Spreed.ME, Google, Facebook, whatever
  so users can sign in with their well known identity.
